# Overview

I chose this project because I didn't have any experience with SQL Databases. I took a dataset that came from Kaggle that was already downloaded onto my computer and turned just one company, Netflix, into a database. I definitely did not get as much done as I would have liked, but I got a new experience. 

My conclusion is that at least for me, data wrangling and analysis is easier to do with Python or R rather than SQL. So If I next time I do a project like this, I will make a database, turn the data into a Pandas dataset, do wrangling/analysis there, then update the database with SQL.

# Future Work

As mentioned before, I would like to limit SQL use to retrieving and updating data. I would like to go further with more analysis using Python in the future.
